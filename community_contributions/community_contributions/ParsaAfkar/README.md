# Travel Planning Agent (Agentic AI)

This project is an **AI-powered travel planning agent** built as part of the *LLM Engineering & Agentic AI* course.

## 📌 Project Description
This agent takes essential travel information from the user and generates a smart, structured travel suggestion.

### The agent receives:
- **Origin city**
- **Destination city**
- **Travel budget**
- **Number of travel days**
- **Weather information (real-time)

### The agent outputs:
- A summarized **travel plan**
- Budget-aware suggestions
- Weather-aware recommendations (clothing, timing, activities)
- A clear and readable final response for the user

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Agentic AI design
- Prompt engineering
- Tool / function-style reasoning
- Structured inputs → structured outputs

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenAI / LLM APIs
- Basic agent architecture

## 🎯 Goal of the Project
To demonstrate how an **AI agent** can:
- Collect multiple user constraints
- Reason over them
- Produce a useful real-world decision (travel planning)
